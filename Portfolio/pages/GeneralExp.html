                    I've been a Game Developer for 3+ years, I've worked as a:
                    Programmer, Game Designer, GFX Artist, Project Lead,
                    Marketing Manager, Community Manager, and a Modeler. I've
                    Primarily been a programmer throughout those years, but I
                    have been a 1 man dev many of times.

                    I've recently started in Web Development, I'm a pretty
                    confident front end developer when it comes to web
                    development. Although I only have about 8 months of
                    experience as of April 26. 2023, I've learned JS, JQuery,
                    JSON, CSS, HTML, pretty quickly thanks to my experience as a
                    programmer before hand. I've also dipped into a bit of full
                    stack, I've learned a bit of powershell, NodeJS, although I
                    wouldn't say I'm very confident in Full Stack Development
                    just yet. Although I have a very good grasp of Full Stack
                    when it comes to the Client and the Server, due to me being
                    a Full Stack Game Developer before hand.
